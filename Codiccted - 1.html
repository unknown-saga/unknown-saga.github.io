	<h1>Introduction to Codiccted</h1>

	<hr style="height: 10px;">

	<h2> Intorduction </h2>
	
	<p>Coding is all about fun and enjoyment. It is a good option for all those who are not that much good in academics, but want a so-called descent job. A coder must first choose what language he wants to learn, and for that, an ample knowledge of certain things are required in large amounts. To choose a language, one must know the uses of that language. Now-a-days, Python and JAVA are the most common languages all over the world. And if once you one knows that along with his capability and interest, he is free to choose the language!</p>
	<p>So, let's begin!</p>

	<h2>My First Language -> Python</h2>

	<p>The first language that I learnt was Python. It was developed by Guido van Rossoum. He is a Dutch programmer. Python was created by the hybridization of different high-level languages like C, C++ and JAVA. It is such a language where programs are short and to the point. It has no complexity of syntaxes. It is a lightly typed language where only the necessary things are typed. It is a great choice for those people who are new to programming. I personally recommend this language to them. <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">Here's the link to it!</a></p>

	<h2>Going forward -> Java</h2>

	<p>After completing my journey in Python, I went on to learn Java. It is, unlike Python, a strongly typed language. Strongly typed in the sense, every inormation needs to be provided to the program for it to be executed. If there's a single error, the IDE will show that to the programmer and ask him/her to corect the syntax. It was developed by James Gosling. Java s a good and really useful language to learn, but I personally won't recommend this to a beginner. It can be learnt later, but not at the first. <a href="www.java.com">Here's the link to it!</a></p>

	<h2>A Little More Experience -> HTML, CSS, JavaScript</h2>

	<p>HyperText Markup Language is a WebDev language which is important for all the coders and progarammers to learn. It is used to create websites that are used by different people for different functions. And be it education or entertainment, foodie or goodie, no matter what! Websites serve the way we want! And to make them work better, HTML is used to update them.</p>
	<p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It, as the name suggests, is used to add styles to the websites built using HTML. It has some spectacular features such as adding the HEXA for colour code and adding graphics to the webpage. It is to be self-learned and impemented on the websites created.</p>
	<p>JavaScript is not at all the same as Java, and it has a lot of difference. Java can be used independently while JavaScript requires HTML and DevTools for working. This is used to controol the functions of a webpage.</p>

	<p>If you like my story, you can also turn up and start learning to code. The only thing you have to do is to join our Codiccted classes and you can learn coding from professionals! Believe me, you won't be cheated!</p>
